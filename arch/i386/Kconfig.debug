config LKCD_DUMP
	tristate "LKCD crash dump support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	---help---
	  Say Y here to enable saving an image of system memory when a panic
	  or other error occurs. Dumps can also be forced with the SysRq+d
	  key if MAGIC_SYSRQ is enabled.

config KERNTYPES
	bool
	depends on LKCD_DUMP
	default y

config LKCD_DUMP_BLOCKDEV
	tristate "LKCD crash dump block device driver"
	depends on LKCD_DUMP
	help
	  Say Y to allow saving crash dumps directly to a disk device.

config LKCD_DUMP_NETDEV
	tristate "LKCD crash dump network device driver"
	depends on LKCD_DUMP
	help
	  Say Y to allow saving crash dumps over a network device.

config LKCD_DUMP_COMPRESS_RLE
	tristate "LKCD crash dump RLE compression"
	depends on LKCD_DUMP
	help
	  Say Y to allow saving dumps with Run Length Encoding compression.

config LKCD_DUMP_COMPRESS_GZIP
	tristate "LKCD crash dump GZIP compression"
	select ZLIB_INFLATE
	select ZLIB_DEFLATE
	depends on LKCD_DUMP
	help
	  Say Y to allow saving dumps with Gnu Zip compression.

config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk" if EMBEDDED && DEBUG_KERNEL
	default y
	help
	  Write kernel log output directly into the VGA buffer or to a serial
	  port.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate
	  with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash.

config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
	bool "Check for stack overflows"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  This option will cause messages to be printed if free stack space
	  drops below a certain limit.

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
	bool "Stack utilization instrumentation"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.

	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.

comment "Page alloc debug is incompatible with Software Suspend on i386"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && SOFTWARE_SUSPEND

config DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
	bool "Page alloc debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && !SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
	help
	  Unmap pages from the kernel linear mapping after free_pages().
	  This results in a large slowdown, but helps to find certain types
	  of memory corruptions.

config DEBUG_RODATA
	bool "Write protect kernel read-only data structures"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Mark the kernel read-only data as write-protected in the pagetables,
	  in order to catch accidental (and incorrect) writes to such const
	  data. This option may have a slight performance impact because a
	  portion of the kernel code won't be covered by a 2MB TLB anymore.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

config 4KSTACKS
	bool "Use 4Kb for kernel stacks instead of 8Kb"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will use a 4Kb stacksize for the
	  kernel stack attached to each process/thread. This facilitates
	  running more threads on a system and also reduces the pressure
	  on the VM subsystem for higher order allocations. This option
	  will also use IRQ stacks to compensate for the reduced stackspace.

config X86_FIND_SMP_CONFIG
	bool
	depends on X86_LOCAL_APIC || X86_VOYAGER
	default y

config X86_MPPARSE
	bool
	depends on X86_LOCAL_APIC && !X86_VISWS
	default y

config KDB
	bool "Built-in Kernel Debugger support"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	select KALLSYMS
	select KALLSYMS_ALL
	help
	  This option provides a built-in kernel debugger.  The built-in
	  kernel debugger contains commands which allow memory to be examined,
	  instructions to be disassembled and breakpoints to be set.  For details,
	  see Documentation/kdb/kdb.mm and the manual pages kdb_bt, kdb_ss, etc.
	  Kdb can also be used via the serial port.  Set up the system to
	  have a serial console (see Documentation/serial-console.txt).
	  The key sequence <escape>KDB on the serial port will cause the
	  kernel debugger to be entered with input from the serial port and
	  output to the serial console.  If unsure, say N.

config KDB_MODULES
	tristate "KDB modules"
	depends on KDB
	help
	  KDB can be extended by adding your own modules, in directory
	  kdb/modules.  This option selects the way that these modules should
	  be compiled, as free standing modules (select M) or built into the
	  kernel (select Y).  If unsure say M.

config KDB_OFF
	bool "KDB off by default"
	depends on KDB
	help
	  Normally kdb is activated by default, as long as CONFIG_KDB is set.
	  If you want to ship a kernel with kdb support but only have kdb
	  turned on when the user requests it then select this option.  When
	  compiled with CONFIG_KDB_OFF, kdb ignores all events unless you boot
	  with kdb=on or you echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/kdb.  This option also
	  works in reverse, if kdb is normally activated, you can boot with
	  kdb=off or echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/kdb to deactivate kdb. If
	  unsure, say N.

config KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC
	int "KDB continues after catastrophic errors"
	depends on KDB
	default "0"
	help
	  This integer controls the behaviour of kdb when the kernel gets a
	  catastrophic error, i.e. for a panic, oops, NMI or other watchdog
	  tripping.  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC interacts with
	  /proc/sys/kernel/kdb and CONFIG_LKCD_DUMP (if your kernel has the
	  LKCD patch).
	  When KDB is active (/proc/sys/kernel/kdb == 1) and a catastrophic
	  error occurs, nothing extra happens until you type 'go'.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 0 (default).  The first time
	  you type 'go', kdb warns you.  The second time you type 'go', KDB
	  tries to continue - no guarantees that the kernel is still usable.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 1.  KDB tries to continue - no
	  guarantees that the kernel is still usable.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 2.  If your kernel has the LKCD
	  patch and LKCD is configured to take a dump then KDB forces a dump.
	  Whether or not a dump is taken, KDB forces a reboot.
	  When KDB is not active (/proc/sys/kernel/kdb == 0) and a catastrophic
	  error occurs, the following steps are automatic, no human
	  intervention is required.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 0 (default) or 1.  KDB attempts
	  to continue - no guarantees that the kernel is still usable.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 2.  If your kernel has the LKCD
	  patch and LKCD is configured to take a dump then KDB automatically
	  forces a dump.  Whether or not a dump is taken, KDB forces a
	  reboot.
	  If you are not sure, say 0.  Read Documentation/kdb/dump.txt before
	  setting to 2.

config KDB_USB
	bool "Support for USB Keyboard in KDB (OHCI only)"
	depends on KDB && USB_OHCI_HCD
	help
	  If you want to use kdb from a OHCI USB keyboard then say Y here.  If you
	  say N then kdb can only be used from a PC (AT) keyboard or a serial
	  console.
