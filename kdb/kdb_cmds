# Initial commands for kdb, alter to suit your needs.
# These commands are executed in kdb_init() context, no SMP, no
# processes.  Commands that require process data (including stack or
# registers) are not reliable this early.  set and bp commands should
# be safe.  Global breakpoint commands affect each cpu as it is booted.
