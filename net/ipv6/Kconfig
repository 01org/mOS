	---help---
	  This is needed for Mobility to work correctly, when the home
	  address of the mobile node is used as it's source address,
	  the route lookup will find the tunnel device as it is first
	  doing a route lookup based on source address and then the
	  destination address.

config IPV6_PRIVACY
	bool "IPv6: Privacy Extensions (RFC 3041) support"
	depends on IPV6
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_MD5
	---help---
	  Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6
	  support.  With this option, additional periodically-alter 
	  pseudo-random global-scope unicast address(es) will assigned to
	  your interface(s).
	
	  By default, kernel do not generate temporary addresses.
	  To use temporary addresses, do
	
	        echo 2 >/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/use_tempaddr 

	  See <file:Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt> for details.

	---help---
	  Support for IP Paylod Compression (RFC3173), typically needed
	  for IPsec.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config IPV6_TUNNEL
	tristate "IPv6: IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on IPV6
	---help---
	  Support for IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels described in RFC 2473. This is
	  needed for mobility to work.

	  If unsure, say N.
