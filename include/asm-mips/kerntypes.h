 * Arch-dependent header file that includes headers for all arch-specific
 * types of interest.
 * The kernel type information is used by the lcrash utility when
 * analyzing system crash dumps or the live system. Using the type
 * information for the running system, rather than kernel header files,
 * makes for a more flexible and robust analysis tool.
