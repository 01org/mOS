What is mOS for HPC
===================

mOS for HPC is an operating systems research project at Intel, targeting
extreme scale HPC systems deploying converged workflows for modeling /
simulation, data analytics, and AI. It aims to deliver a high performance
computing environment with the scalability, low noise, and repeatability
expected of lightweight kernels (LWK), while maintaining overall Linux
compatibility that HPC plus AI / ML applications need.

mOS for HPC remains under development at this time. These materials are being
made available to interested parties to explore, to test drive, and to provide
feedback through the mailing list. Consider the quality level to be pre-alpha
and as-is. It is not intended to be used in production or for business critical
uses. The ability to compile, install, and boot a Linux kernel is required to
get mOS up and running. A good understanding of what an OS does and how it
interacts with the underlying hardware is needed to configure the LWK partition
and get the most out of it. Support is limited by the development team's
ability to respond through the mailing list.

New for v0.9
============
