- fbdev: use a new activate flag to tell drivers to apply a mode even if it didn't
  change. Call set_var() with this flag when switching from KD_GRAPHICS back to
  text mode. That should fix most of the problems of apps banging the HW and
  leaving it in an incorrect state. (XFree still should be shot for banging the
  HW on exit when it's not the front VT)

* fbdev: add a couple of routines to suspend/resume display on a framebuffer.
  Resume will additionally restore the screen. To be called by the drivers when
  they are power managed

- fbdev: make fbset work properly again ! stty isn't a solution for lots of
  cases (supposedly done in jsimmons tree)

- look at scsi P.M (hrm....)

- get rid of "pre-parsed" fields in the device-tree. Everything should come
  from properties. PCI drivers don't need addr parsing, mac-io based drivers
  can parse "reg" (or it can be done by macio_asic and stored as resources),
  etc... As far as interrupts are concerned, I need to think about it, we
  shall either have an helper that walks the interrupt tree to get the
  vector, or we still do a one-time parsing and store those in linux,irq
  properties. The later is probably better at first.
  We probably also want to factor the strings in the device tree memory
  representation when building it from OF.
  -> partially done, macio drivers now have resource management

* figure out breakage of release_OF_resource on macio devices (probably
  getting to the wrong resource)

- Implement DMA api instead of using generic stuff

- Move more of arch/ppc/platforms/pmac* to drivers/macintosh. I want to
  rework the way "features" are done, but I still can't find a new design
  that would please me while not copying what Apple did in darwin ...
  I probably want to split that file in per-chipset files (gc, ohare,
  heathrow/paddington, keylargo, uninorth, etc...) though the way those
  would "advertise" their routines still need to be defined. What about
  hooking function pointers to the device-tree ?

- Use device-tree values to fill the PCI latency setting and add fixups
  for the values of uninorth devices like darwin does

- Rework swim3 using BIO properly, dealing with hotswap (should be rmmod'able
  as well), and including paulus latest fixes. Also adapt it to new model

- Port ADB to new driver model, add various settings (trackpad tap, kbd Fn
  key behaviour etc...) to sysfs attribute files

- Add PHY layer & ethtool support to bmac driver

- G5 sound drivers (probably want a complete rewrite of dmasound if we decide
  to keep that driver around, or just base on Alsa)

- While we are at sound: proper refcounting of KeyLargo clocks for better PM
  and separate I2S channel configuration

- Rework PPC arch whole interrupt management to finally deal with cascaded
  controllers properly, also get rid of the linar irq_desc array
