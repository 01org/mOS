 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: bus ID of the LCS device
 *   @2: network interface
 * Description:
 * LAN channel station (LCS) devices require a socket buffer (SKB) structure
 * for storing incoming data. The LCS device driver failed to allocate an SKB
 * structure to the LCS device. A likely cause of this problem is memory
 * constraints.
 * User action:
 * Free some memory and repeat the failed operation.
