 * Text: "%d is not a valid number of XPRAM devices\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: number of partitions
 * Description:
 * The number of XPRAM partitions specified for the 'devs' module parameter
 * or with the 'xpram.parts' kernel parameter must be an integer in the
 * range 1 to 32. The XPRAM device driver created a maximum of 32 partitions
 * that are probably not configured as intended.
 * User action:
 * If the XPRAM device driver has been compiled as a separate module,
 * unload the module and load it again with a correct value for the
 * 'devs' module parameter. If the XPRAM device driver has been compiled
 * into the kernel, correct the 'xpram.parts' parameter in the kernel
 * command line and restart Linux.

 * Text: "Not enough expanded memory available\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Description:
 * The amount of expanded memory required to set up your XPRAM partitions
 * depends on the 'sizes' parameter specified for the xpram module or on
 * the specifications for the 'xpram.parts' parameter if the XPRAM device
 * driver has been compiled into the kernel. Your
 * current specification exceed the amount of available expanded memory.
 * Your XPRAM partitions are probably not configured as intended.
 * User action:
 * If the XPRAM device driver has been compiled as a separate module,
 * unload the xpram module and load it again with an appropriate value
 * for the 'sizes' module parameter. If the XPRAM device driver has been
 * compiled into the kernel, adjust the 'xpram.parts' parameter in the
 * kernel command line and restart Linux. If you need more than the
 * available expanded memory, increase the expanded memory allocation for
 * your virtual hardware or LPAR.
