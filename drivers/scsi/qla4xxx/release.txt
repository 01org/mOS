IV.	Known Issues
- No support for in-kernel builds with this release.
- Port going offline and online occasionally is due 
  to a command timeout, so increase the device timeout
  in sysfs.
- A system reboot maybe required to be able to load
  the driver successfully using modprobe.
- Target Devices deleted from the SANsurfer Management 
  Application may still be displayed under /proc/scsi/qla4xxx/<xx>
  Unload/Load of the Driver should delete those entries.
