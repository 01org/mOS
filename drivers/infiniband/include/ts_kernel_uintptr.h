/*
  We define a uintptr_t type for use in kernel space.  To ease
  portability to Windows (in particular Win64), uintptr_t should be
  used in preference to "unsigned long" when a pointer is cast to an
  integral type.  This is because unsigned long is always 32 bits
  under Windows, so under Win64, casting a pointer to unsigned long
  will truncate the pointer.
