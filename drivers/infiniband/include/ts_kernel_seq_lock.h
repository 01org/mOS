/*
  Lockless consistency primitives, for use when reads are much more
  common than writes.  These primitives allow lockless reads; even if
  multiple CPUs are reading, there is no need to bounce a lock's
  cacheline between CPUs.  In addition, writers are not starved by
  readers.

  USAGE:

    Declaration and initialization:

      struct foo {
        // ...
        tTS_SEQ_LOCK_STRUCT seq_lock;
      };

      struct foo bar;
      tsSeqLockInit(&bar.seq_lock);

    Reading:

      unsigned int seq;

      do {
        seq = tsSeqLockReadBegin(&bar.seq_lock);
        // read from bar
      } while (tsSeqLockReadEnd(&bar.seq_lock, seq));

    Writing:

      // lock bar against other writers, if necessary
      tsSeqLockWriteBegin(&bar.seq_lock);
      // write to bar
      tsSeqLockWriteEnd(&bar.seq_lock);
      // unlock bar, if necessary

  THEORY OF OPERATION:

    A "serial number" is kept for the data.  The serial number starts
    at 0, and is incremented once before the data is written and once
    after the data is written.  Therefore, the serial number will be
    odd while the data is being changed.

    This means that if a reader makes sure that the serial numbers
    before and after reading are the same and even, no writes took
    place while reading the data.  No locks need to be taken to check
    this.  Reads by different CPUs will not invalidate cached versions
    of the serial number, so if no writes are taking place, there will
    be no "cache-line ping-pong."

    If multiple writers can touch the data, then extra (writer-only)
    locking will be required, for example a spinlock.

    The smp_rmb() and smp_wmb() calls are needed to ensure that this
    works on systems where different CPUs may not have in-order views
    of each other's memory access.
