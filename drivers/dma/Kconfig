config DMA_ENGINE
	bool "Support for DMA engines"
	---help---
	  DMA engines offload copy operations from the CPU to dedicated
	  hardware, allowing the copies to happen asynchronously.

config NET_DMA
	bool "Network: TCP receive copy offload"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE
	default y
	---help---
	  This enables the use of DMA engines in the network stack to
	  offload receive copy-to-user operations, freeing CPU cycles.
	  Since this is the main user of the DMA engine, it should be enabled;
	  say Y here.
