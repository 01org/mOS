config DMA_ENGINE
	bool "Support for DMA engines"
	---help---
	  DMA engines offload copy operations from the CPU to dedicated
	  hardware, allowing the copies to happen asynchronously.

config NET_DMA
	bool "Network: TCP receive copy offload"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE && NET
	default y
	---help---
	  This enables the use of DMA engines in the network stack to
	  offload receive copy-to-user operations, freeing CPU cycles.
	  Since this is the main user of the DMA engine, it should be enabled;
	  say Y here.

config DMA_TESTCLIENT
	tristate "Test DMA client"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE
	---help---
	  The test client driver performs a DMA-assisted memcpy on module
	  load, and prints the result when unloaded. It is pretty simple, but
	  perhaps is useful as a demonstration of the DMA subsystem API.

comment "DMA Devices"

config INTEL_IOATDMA
	tristate "Intel I/OAT DMA support"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE && PCI
	default m
	---help---
	  Enable support for the Intel(R) I/OAT DMA engine.
