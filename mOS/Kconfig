	  Build as mOS (short for "multi-O/S"), an experimental kernel
	  for supercomputers which attempts to create a hybrid between a
	  FWK (full-weight kernel--namely, Linux) and a custom LWK
	  (light-weight kernel) in order to acheive better performance
	  and scaling behavior than FWKs alone.

	  Unless you operate a top-500 supercomputer, say N.
